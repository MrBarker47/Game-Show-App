# Game-Show-App


- Overview - I built this project as a part of this bootcamp I graducated from a few months back. This was tough a project for me, because 
it was challenging my JavaScript skills. 


- Features - This project is like word puzzle type of game. If you click on the right letter, then it will show up on the screen. If you click on the wrong the letter
  then you will lose a life. The game has six random phrases, and underneath you're met with a keyboard where your letters are place. After that you'll see 5 hearts
